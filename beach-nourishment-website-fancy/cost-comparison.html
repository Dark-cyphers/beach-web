        <h1>Cost Comparison</h1>
        <p>Beach nourishment generally costs between $1 million and $10 million per mile, depending on the location and amount of sand needed.</p>
        <p><b>Compared to seawalls:</b> Seawalls can cost $2 million to $15 million per mile, but they have a much longer lifespan. However, seawalls often cause beach erosion downstream, which can lead to additional costs later.</p>
        <p>Overall, beach nourishment is often cheaper in the short term but needs repeated investment, while seawalls are expensive up front but more permanent.</p>
